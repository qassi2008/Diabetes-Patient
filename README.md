# Diabetes Readmission Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict hospital readmission for patients with diabetes using data from 130 US hospitals between 1999 and 2008. 
The analysis and models developed in the Jupyter notebook "Diabetes_130_US.ipynb" provide insights into factors influencing readmissions and help improve healthcare interventions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes over 100,000 hospital admissions from patients with a diagnosis of diabetes.


## Features
- The dataset includes several features such as:
- Patient number
 - Race
Gender
Age
Admission type
Time in hospital
Medical specialty of the admitting physician
Number of lab tests performed
Medication administration
Diabetic medications
Readmission status

## Models
The notebook explores several machine learning models including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines
Neural Networks


## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Usage
The notebook is divided into several sections, each corresponding to different stages of the analysis:

#### Data Exploration: 
Understand the data distributions and summaries.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for modeling.
Model Building: Construct and train machine learning models.
Evaluation: Assess model performance with various metrics.
